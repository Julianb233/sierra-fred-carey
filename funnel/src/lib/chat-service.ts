Before you think about raising, ask yourself:\n\n1. **Do you have product-market fit?** If not, raising money won't fix that.\n2. **What's your burn rate?** How long can you run without outside capital?\n3. **What would you do with the money?** If you can't answer specifically, you're not ready.\n\nOn the full Sahara platform, I can run a complete Investor Readiness Assessment and review your pitch deck. Want to explore that, or should we dig deeper into where you are right now?"

Founders lead with the solution instead of the problem. Investors need to feel the pain before they care about your fix.\n\nOn the full Sahara platform, I can do a detailed pitch deck review with scoring. For now — what stage is your deck at?"

Here's what I'd focus on in order:\n\n1. **Talk to 10+ potential customers** — Don't build anything until you've validated the problem exists and people will pay to solve it.\n2. **Write a one-page business brief** — Forces you to clarify your thinking.\n3. **Build a bare-bones MVP** — The simplest thing that solves the core problem.\n\nDon't overthink it. The best founders I've worked with moved fast, talked to customers constantly, and iterated based on feedback.\n\nCheck out the Founder Journey tab to see the full roadmap. What's your idea about?"

Here are the most common for startups:\n\n- **SaaS/Subscription** — Recurring revenue, predictable, investors love it\n- **Marketplace** — Take rate on transactions (harder to start, powerful at scale)\n- **Usage-based** — Pay as you go (great for dev tools, APIs)\n- **Freemium** — Free tier to acquire, paid to convert\n\nMy advice: start with the simplest model that gets you to revenue fastest.

What does success look like for you in the next 90 days?\n\nThe more specific you are, the more I can help. And remember — on the full Sahara platform, I can do deep dives with pitch deck reviews, investor readiness scoring, and more.",

Here's what I'd think about:\n\nEvery startup challenge usually boils down to one of three things:\n- **Product** — Are you building something people want?\n- **Distribution** — Can you reach your customers efficiently?\n- **Economics** — Does the math work?\n\nWhich of these feels most relevant to where you are? Let's dig into it together.",

Can you explain what you do in one sentence? (Clarity)\n3. Do you know your next 3 moves? (Execution)\n\nIf you can't answer all three confidently, that's where we should focus. Which one feels weakest for you?",
