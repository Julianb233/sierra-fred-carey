# Phase 32-01: TTS Chat Integration + Memory Browser Completion

**Phase:** 32 — FRED Intelligence Upgrade
**Plan:** 01 of 2
**Status:** PENDING
**Depends on:** None (core TTS, memory, export infrastructure already built)

## Goal

The TTS controller, memory system, and export API are all built. This plan wires TTS into the chat message display and completes the memory browser UI with search, pagination, and management features.

## Steps

### Step 1: Add "Read Aloud" button to chat messages
**Files:** `components/chat/chat-message.tsx` or equivalent chat message component
Find the component that renders individual chat messages. Add:
- Import the existing `TTSButton` from `components/chat/tts-button.tsx`
- Render `<TTSButton text={message.content} />` on assistant messages only
- Position the button as a small icon in the message footer (next to timestamp)
- Only show for messages longer than 20 characters

### Step 2: Complete MemoryManager component
**Files:** `components/memory/memory-manager.tsx`
Read the existing file if it exists, then implement or complete:
- Memory usage stats: total facts, total episodes, total decisions
- Category filter dropdown for facts (10 categories)
- Search bar with debounce (300ms) that filters across all memory types
- Bulk delete button with confirmation dialog
- Memory usage bar showing count vs tier limit
- Refresh button to reload data

### Step 3: Add pagination to memory browser
**Files:** `app/dashboard/memory/page.tsx`
- Add pagination (20 items per page) for each tab
- Previous/Next buttons with page counter
- Load data from `/api/fred/memory` with limit and offset params
- Show total count per tab

### Step 4: Add delete confirmation for individual items
**Files:** `app/dashboard/memory/page.tsx`
- Add delete button on each fact/episode item
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Call DELETE `/api/fred/memory` with category and key
- Optimistic UI update (remove from list immediately, restore on error)

### Step 5: Add copy-to-clipboard for fact values
**Files:** `app/dashboard/memory/page.tsx`
- Add a copy icon button on each semantic fact
- Copy the fact value to clipboard
- Show toast: "Copied to clipboard"

## Verification

- [ ] TTSButton appears on assistant chat messages
- [ ] MemoryManager shows stats, category filter, search, and bulk delete
- [ ] Memory browser has pagination (20 per page)
- [ ] Individual items can be deleted with confirmation
- [ ] Fact values can be copied to clipboard
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- [ ] `npm run test` passes

## Files Changed

- Chat message component — added TTSButton to assistant messages
- `components/memory/memory-manager.tsx` — completed with stats, filters, search, bulk delete
- `app/dashboard/memory/page.tsx` — added pagination, delete confirmation, copy-to-clipboard
