<objective>
Fix the dashboard sidebar navigation to include the Decision History link and correct the Investor Readiness link.

Purpose: Two navigation gaps exist: (1) there is no sidebar link to `/dashboard/history` (Decision History page exists but is unreachable from nav), and (2) the "Investor Score" link points to `/dashboard/investor-score` instead of the actual Investor Readiness page at `/dashboard/investor-readiness`.

Output: Updated `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` with corrected `navItems` array.

  <name>Task 1: Fix dashboard nav items</name>
  <files>app/dashboard/layout.tsx, app/dashboard/page.tsx, app/dashboard/journey/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Edit the `navItems` array in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` and fix stale links in two other dashboard files. Three files total:

  1. **Add Decision History link.** Insert a new nav item for Decision History AFTER the "Your Journey" item (or alongside other Free-tier items). Use these values:
     ```
     {
       name: "Decision History",
       href: "/dashboard/history",
       icon: <ActivityLogIcon className="h-4 w-4" />,
       badge: "Free",
     }
     ```
     Note: `ActivityLogIcon` is already imported from `@radix-ui/react-icons` (line 22). However, it is currently used by the "Monitoring" item. To avoid icon duplication, use a different icon for Decision History. Options already imported:
     - `CheckCircledIcon` (used by Weekly Check-ins)
     - Use a clock or history icon instead. Import `CountdownTimerIcon` from `@radix-ui/react-icons` for the history item. Add it to the existing import block.

     Alternatively, since both Monitoring and History are conceptually different, sharing `ActivityLogIcon` is acceptable. Use your judgment -- the simplest approach is to add `CountdownTimerIcon` to the import and use it for Decision History.

  2. **Fix Investor Readiness link.** Find the nav item with `name: "Investor Score"` and `href: "/dashboard/investor-score"` (around line 85-90). Change it to:
     ```
     {
       name: "Investor Readiness",
       href: "/dashboard/investor-readiness",
       icon: <PersonIcon className="h-4 w-4" />,
       tier: 1,
       badge: "Pro",
     }
     ```
     Keep the same icon (`PersonIcon`), tier, and badge. Just change `name` and `href`.

  3. **Ensure reasonable nav order.** The nav items should flow logically:
     - Free tier items first: Overview, Reality Lens, Your Journey, Decision History, AI Insights, Monitoring
     - Pro tier items: Positioning, Investor Lens, Investor Readiness, Pitch Deck Review, Strategy Docs, Weekly Check-ins
     - Studio tier items: Virtual Team, Boardy Integration
     - Settings at the bottom

  Make NO other changes to the layout file. Only touch the `navItems` array and the import statement (if adding a new icon).

  4. **Fix stale /dashboard/investor-score links in other pages.** Two other files also link to the old path:
     - `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (around line 161): Change `href: "/dashboard/investor-score"` to `href: "/dashboard/investor-readiness"`. Also update the display name from "Investor Score" to "Investor Readiness" if present.
     - `app/dashboard/journey/page.tsx` (around lines 411, 423): Two links to `/dashboard/investor-score`. Change both to `/dashboard/investor-readiness`. Update display text if applicable.

     Search the entire `app/` directory for any remaining `/dashboard/investor-score` references and fix them all.
  </action>
  <verify>
  Run these checks:
  1. `grep -n "dashboard/history" app/dashboard/layout.tsx` returns a match showing the History nav item
  2. `grep -n "investor-readiness" app/dashboard/layout.tsx` returns a match showing the IRS nav item
  3. `grep -rn "investor-score" app/dashboard/` returns NO matches in any dashboard file (old links removed from layout, page.tsx, and journey/page.tsx)
  4. `npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -i "layout"` shows no TypeScript errors in the layout file
  </verify>
  <done>
  Dashboard sidebar contains "Decision History" linking to `/dashboard/history` and "Investor Readiness" linking to `/dashboard/investor-readiness`. The old "Investor Score" link to `/dashboard/investor-score` is gone. Nav order is logical (Free -> Pro -> Studio -> Settings).
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `grep -c "dashboard/history" app/dashboard/layout.tsx` returns 1
2. `grep -c "investor-readiness" app/dashboard/layout.tsx` returns 1
3. `grep -rc "investor-score" app/dashboard/` returns 0 for all files
4. TypeScript compilation succeeds for the layout file
5. Nav items are ordered: Free tier, Pro tier, Studio tier, Settings
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Dashboard sidebar includes "Decision History" link to /dashboard/history
- Dashboard sidebar includes "Investor Readiness" link to /dashboard/investor-readiness
- No link to /dashboard/investor-score remains in any dashboard file (layout, page.tsx, journey/page.tsx)
- Layout file compiles without TypeScript errors
</success_criteria>
