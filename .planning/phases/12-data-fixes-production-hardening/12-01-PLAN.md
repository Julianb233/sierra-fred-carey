<objective>
Fix all data inconsistencies across the marketing site, AI prompts, and feature labels so that every page displays one canonical, correct value for capital raised, years of experience, SMS tier placement, and studio feature availability.

Purpose: The website currently shows conflicting data -- "$50M+" vs "$100M+" for capital raised, "20+" vs "30+" vs "40+" vs "50+" for years of experience, and SMS Check-Ins listed under both Pro and Studio tiers. These inconsistencies undermine user trust and create confusion.

Output: All marketing stats sourced from a single MARKETING_STATS constant in fred-brain.ts. About page rewritten to match Fred Cary's actual biography. Feature availability labels synchronized between pricing and features pages.

**Step 1: Add MARKETING_STATS to fred-brain.ts**

Add a new exported constant after the existing SAHARA_MESSAGING export (around line 393), before the helper functions section:

```typescript
export const MARKETING_STATS = {
  capitalRaised: "$100M+",
  foundersCoached: "10,000+",
  yearsExperience: "50+",
  companiesFounded: "40+",
  startupsLaunched: "300+",
  ipos: "3",
  acquisitions: "2",
} as const;
```

The capital raised value is "$100M+" (the higher, more accurate number from the About page). All other files must import and use these values.

**Step 2: Fix components/hero.tsx (line ~177)**

Import MARKETING_STATS from fred-brain.ts at the top of the file. Change the trust indicators array (around line 175-179):
- `"$50M+ Raised"` --> `\`${MARKETING_STATS.capitalRaised} Raised\``
- `"10,000+ Founders Coached"` --> `\`${MARKETING_STATS.foundersCoached} Founders Coached\``

**Step 3: Fix components/footer.tsx (line ~58)**

Import MARKETING_STATS from fred-brain.ts. Change the tagline text (around line 58):
- `"Built by Fred Cary — 10,000+ founders coached, $50M+ raised."`
- --> `\`Built by Fred Cary — ${MARKETING_STATS.foundersCoached} founders coached, ${MARKETING_STATS.capitalRaised} raised.\``

**Step 4: Fix components/testimonials.tsx (line ~256)**

Import MARKETING_STATS from fred-brain.ts. Change (around line 256):
- `"$50M+ raised by users"` --> `\`${MARKETING_STATS.capitalRaised} raised by users\``

**Step 5: Fix lib/fred/pitch/analyzers/index.ts (line ~129)**

Change the system prompt text:
- `"30+ years of experience"` --> `"50+ years of experience"`
This is in a template literal string in the generateObject call.

**Step 6: Fix lib/fred/strategy/generator.ts (line ~150)**

Change the buildSystemPrompt function:
- `"40+ years of experience"` --> `"50+ years of experience"`

**Step 7: Fix README.md (line ~11)**

Change:
- `"$50M+ raised"` --> `"$100M+ raised"`

**Step 8: Fix app/about/page.tsx -- Complete rewrite of data sections**

This file requires a substantial rewrite. The entire about page was written for a generic founder persona, not Fred Cary.

a) **Stats array (lines 17-22):** Replace with:
```typescript
const stats = [
  { value: "10,000+", label: "Founders Coached" },
  { value: "50+", label: "Years Experience" },
  { value: "$100M+", label: "Capital Raised" },
  { value: "40+", label: "Companies Founded" },
];
```

b) **Timeline array (lines 24-49):** Replace with Fred's actual timeline from fred-brain.ts:
```typescript
const timeline = [
  {
    year: "1974",
    title: "The Beginning",
    description: "Started first venture at age 17 as a musician in a rock band, learning the hustle that would define a career.",
    icon: RocketIcon,
  },
  {
    year: "1984",
    title: "Legal Foundation",
    description: "Earned JD from Thomas Jefferson School of Law, adding legal expertise to entrepreneurial drive.",
    icon: TargetIcon,
  },
  {
    year: "2000s",
    title: "Building & Scaling",
    description: "Founded Boxlot ($50M IPO), Path1 Network ($120M acquisition), and Imagine Communications, reaching 75% of world TV households.",
    icon: LightningBoltIcon,
  },
  {
    year: "2024",
    title: "Sahara Launch",
    description: "Launched the AI-powered Founder Decision OS, bringing 50+ years of entrepreneurial wisdom to every founder.",
    icon: CheckCircledIcon,
  },
];
```

c) **Values array (lines 51-72):** Fix the "20+" reference:
```typescript
{
  icon: CheckCircledIcon,
  title: "Data-Driven",
  description: "Decisions informed by 50+ years of founder patterns, powered by AI insights.",
},
```

d) **Hero section text (line ~119):** Change:
- `"over two decades"` --> `"over five decades"`

e) **Story section (lines ~197-250):** Rewrite to match Fred Cary's actual story. Replace:
- `"I started my first company in 1999, fresh out of college"` --> `"I started hustling at 17 — first as a musician in a rock band, then slinging tacos at 22. By the time I got my law degree, I already knew the courtroom wasn't going to be my only arena."`
- `"Over the next 20 years"` --> `"Over the next five decades"`
- `"two decades of founder coaching insights"` --> `"five decades of entrepreneurial experience"`
- Keep the general narrative arc (started young, coached thousands, built AI) but ground it in Fred's actual journey of founding 40+ companies, 3 IPOs, and coaching 10,000+ founders.

After ALL changes, run a final verification grep to ensure zero remaining hardcoded instances of "$50M", "30+", "40+" (in years context), or "20+" in marketing contexts.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run these grep searches to confirm no stale values remain:

```bash
# Should return ZERO results in component/page files (only fred-brain.ts constants are OK)
grep -rn '"\$50M' components/ app/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -rn '"20+"' app/about/page.tsx
grep -rn '"30+ years' lib/ --include="*.ts"
grep -rn '"40+ years' lib/ --include="*.ts"
grep -rn 'two decades' app/about/page.tsx
grep -rn '1999' app/about/page.tsx
```

Also verify the build compiles:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20
```
  </verify>
  <done>
DATA-01: Capital raised shows "$100M+" consistently across hero, footer, testimonials, about page, and README -- all imported from MARKETING_STATS in fred-brain.ts.
DATA-02: Years of experience shows "50+" in all AI prompts (pitch analyzers, strategy generator) and all marketing copy (about page stats, values, story).
DATA-05: About page stats now show "50+ Years Experience" and "$100M+ Capital Raised" (differentiated from interactive page's product metrics by context).
DATA-06: About page timeline uses Fred's actual milestones (1974 start at 17, 1984 JD, 2000s IPOs/acquisitions, 2024 Sahara launch). Story section rewritten to match fred-brain.ts biography.

**Step 1: Fix SMS Check-Ins in lib/constants.ts (DATA-03)**

In the TIER_FEATURES object, remove "Automated Weekly SMS Check-Ins" from the PRO tier features array (line ~82). The SMS feature already correctly appears in the STUDIO tier as "Weekly SMS Accountability Check-ins" (line ~90).

Before:
```typescript
[UserTier.PRO]: [
    "Everything in Free tier",
    "Full Investor Lens (Pre-Seed / Seed / Series A)",
    "Investor Readiness Score",
    "Pitch Deck Review & Scorecard",
    "Strategy Documents",
    "Automated Weekly SMS Check-Ins",    // REMOVE THIS LINE
    "Persistent founder memory",
],
```

After:
```typescript
[UserTier.PRO]: [
    "Everything in Free tier",
    "Full Investor Lens (Pre-Seed / Seed / Series A)",
    "Investor Readiness Score",
    "Pitch Deck Review & Scorecard",
    "Strategy Documents",
    "Persistent founder memory",
],
```

**Step 2: Fix SMS in components/pricing.tsx (DATA-03)**

Remove "Automated Weekly SMS Check-Ins" from the Fundraising ($99) plan's features array (around line 66). The feature should only appear in the Venture Studio ($249) plan.

**Step 3: Fix SMS in app/pricing/page.tsx (DATA-03)**

In the Fundraising & Strategy plan features (around line 55):
- Remove the line `{ name: "Weekly SMS Check-Ins", included: true }` from the $99 plan features array.
- In the Free plan, change `{ name: "Weekly SMS Check-Ins", included: false }` to keep it as `included: false` (which is correct -- it shows an X).

In the comparison table (comparisonFeatures array, around line 99):
- Change `{ name: "Weekly SMS Check-Ins", free: false, fundraising: true, studio: true }`
- to `{ name: "Weekly SMS Check-Ins", free: false, fundraising: false, studio: true }`

**Step 4: Fix SMS in app/features/page.tsx (DATA-03)**

Move "Weekly SMS Check-Ins" from the Pro ($99/month) section to the Venture Studio ($249/month) section. Currently it appears at line ~69 in the Pro features. Remove it from Pro and add it to the Studio features array.

**Step 5: Synchronize "Coming Soon" labels between features and pricing pages (DATA-04)**

The pricing page (app/pricing/page.tsx) correctly marks all Studio-exclusive features as `comingSoon: true`. The features page (app/features/page.tsx) inconsistently omits `comingSoon` on some items.

In app/features/page.tsx Studio features (around lines 83-116), add `comingSoon: true` to features that are NOT yet built:
- "Boardy Integration" -- Add `comingSoon: true` (the features page incorrectly omits it; pricing page has it as comingSoon)
- "Founder Ops Agent" -- Add `comingSoon: true` (features page incorrectly shows as available)
- "Fundraise Ops Agent" -- Add `comingSoon: true` (features page incorrectly shows as available)
- "Growth Ops Agent" -- Add `comingSoon: true` (features page incorrectly shows as available)
- "Investor Targeting Guidance" -- Already has `comingSoon: true` (correct)
- "Outreach Sequencing" -- Already has `comingSoon: true` (correct)
- "Inbox Ops Agent" -- Already has `comingSoon: true` (correct)

Also add "Weekly SMS Check-Ins" to the Studio features section with `comingSoon: false` (SMS is actually built and working).
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify SMS is not in Pro tier:
```bash
# Check constants - PRO should NOT mention SMS
grep -A 10 'UserTier.PRO' lib/constants.ts | grep -i 'sms'
# Should return nothing

# Check pricing component
grep -B 5 -A 1 'SMS' components/pricing.tsx
# Should only show it in Venture Studio section

# Check pricing page comparison table
grep 'SMS' app/pricing/page.tsx
# fundraising should be false

# Check features page
grep -B 2 'SMS' app/features/page.tsx
# Should be in Studio section only
```

Verify comingSoon consistency:
```bash
# Both files should mark the same features as comingSoon
grep 'comingSoon' app/features/page.tsx
grep 'comingSoon' app/pricing/page.tsx
```

Type check:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20
```
  </verify>
  <done>
DATA-03: SMS Check-Ins appears exclusively in Studio tier ($249) across lib/constants.ts, components/pricing.tsx, app/pricing/page.tsx, and app/features/page.tsx. Removed from all Pro tier feature lists. Comparison table shows fundraising: false for SMS.
DATA-04: Studio features page "Coming Soon" labels synchronized with pricing page -- Boardy Integration, all 4 agents (Founder Ops, Fundraise Ops, Growth Ops, Inbox Ops), Investor Targeting Guidance, and Outreach Sequencing all show "Coming Soon" on both pages.
  </done>
</task>

After both tasks complete, verify the phase success criteria for data consistency:

1. **Capital raised consistency:**
   ```bash
   grep -rn 'capitalRaised\|capital.raised\|\$50M\|\$100M' components/ app/ lib/fred-brain.ts --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v node_modules | grep -v '.test.'
   ```
   Every instance should reference MARKETING_STATS or show "$100M+".

2. **Years of experience consistency:**
   ```bash
   grep -rn 'years.*experience\|yearsExperience\|"20+"\|"30+"\|"40+"' lib/ app/ components/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v node_modules | grep -v '.test.'
   ```
   Every instance should show "50+" or import from fred-brain.ts.

3. **SMS tier placement:**
   ```bash
   grep -rn -i 'sms.*check' lib/constants.ts components/pricing.tsx app/pricing/page.tsx app/features/page.tsx
   ```
   Should only appear in Studio tier sections.

4. **Build passes:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Zero instances of "$50M+" in any component or page file (all replaced with MARKETING_STATS.capitalRaised = "$100M+")
- Zero instances of "30+ years" or "40+ years" or "20+ years" in any AI prompt or marketing copy
- SMS Check-Ins removed from all Pro ($99) tier feature lists and comparison tables
- Studio features page comingSoon labels match pricing page comingSoon labels exactly
- About page timeline matches Fred Cary's actual biography (started at 17, JD in 1984, IPOs in 2000s)
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
</success_criteria>
