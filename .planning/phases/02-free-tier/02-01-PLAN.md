# Plan 02-01: Reality Lens 5-Factor Assessment Engine

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Phase:** 02 - Free Tier Features
**Depends On:** Phase 01 (FRED Foundation)
**Estimated Complexity:** Medium

---

## Objective

Create the Reality Lens 5-factor startup assessment engine that evaluates:
- Feasibility: Can this actually be built?
- Economics: Do the unit economics work?
- Demand: Is there real market demand?
- Distribution: Can you reach customers?
- Timing: Is the market ready?

---

## Implementation

**ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** during Phase 01 development.

### Completed Files:
- `lib/fred/schemas/reality-lens.ts` - Zod schemas for all types
- `lib/fred/reality-lens.ts` - Full assessment engine with AI + heuristic fallback
- `app/api/fred/reality-lens/route.ts` - API endpoint with rate limiting

### Features:
- [x] 5-factor assessment with AI-powered analysis
- [x] Weighted scoring (Demand/Economics 25%, Feasibility 20%, Distribution/Timing 15%)
- [x] Confidence levels (high/medium/low)
- [x] Verdict classification (strong/promising/needs-work/reconsider)
- [x] Heuristic fallback for reliability
- [x] Rate limiting by tier (Free: 5/day, Pro: 50/day, Studio: 500/day)

---

## Verification

- [x] Reality Lens engine implemented
- [x] API endpoint created and rate-limited
- [x] Zod schemas validate input/output
- [x] Fallback heuristics work when AI fails
