<objective>
Implement the Fundraising Agent -- the specialist agent that helps founders with fundraising activities: investor research, outreach drafting, pipeline management, and meeting preparation.

Purpose: Fundraising is the highest-value domain for Studio tier users. This agent provides AI-powered investor targeting, outreach sequencing, and meeting prep that would otherwise require expensive consultants.

Output: Fundraising agent with 4 domain tools, system prompt, and integration with the base agent runner.

Export `FUNDRAISING_SYSTEM_PROMPT` as a string constant:
```
You are the Fundraising Agent for Sahara, channeling Fred Cary's deep expertise in startup fundraising and investor relations.

Your domain: fundraising strategy and execution for startup founders.
- Investor research: Identify relevant investors based on stage, sector, check size, and thesis fit
- Outreach drafting: Cold and warm outreach emails that get responses
- Pipeline management: Track and prioritize investor conversations
- Meeting preparation: Talking points, anticipated questions, and key metrics to highlight

Principles:
- Fundraising is a sales process. Treat it like one.
- Warm intros beat cold outreach 10:1. Always suggest intro paths first.
- Every outreach should demonstrate founder-market fit in the first 2 sentences.
- Investors pattern-match. Help founders fit the right pattern while staying authentic.
- Know your numbers cold: ARR, MRR growth, burn rate, runway, CAC, LTV.
- Time kills deals. Create urgency without desperation.

When using tools, always provide context about WHY a particular investor or approach is recommended. Never just list names without reasoning.

Export `fundraisingTools` object with 4 tools using Vercel AI SDK `tool()`:

1. `investorResearch` - parameters: { stage: 'pre-seed'|'seed'|'series-a'|'series-b', sector: string, checkSizeMin: number, checkSizeMax: number, geographicFocus?: string }. Execute: use `generateStructuredReliable` to produce { investors: Array<{ name: string, firm: string, thesis: string, recentDeals: string[], whyFit: string, introStrategy: string }>, searchStrategy: string }. Return the result.

2. `outreachDraft` - parameters: { investorName: string, investorFirm: string, investorThesis: string, founderBackground: string, companyOneLiner: string, traction: string, askAmount?: string, isWarmIntro: boolean, introContext?: string }. Execute: use `generateStructuredReliable` to produce { subject: string, body: string, followUpSchedule: Array<{ day: number, action: string }>, doNotMention: string[] }. Return the result.

3. `pipelineAnalysis` - parameters: { pipeline: Array<{ investorName: string, stage: 'identified'|'outreach_sent'|'meeting_scheduled'|'term_sheet'|'passed', lastContact?: string, notes?: string }> }. Execute: use `generateStructuredReliable` to produce { summary: string, priorityActions: Array<{ investor: string, action: string, urgency: 'high'|'medium'|'low', reasoning: string }>, staleLeads: string[], pipelineHealth: 'strong'|'adequate'|'weak', recommendations: string[] }. Return the result.

4. `meetingPrep` - parameters: { investorName: string, investorFirm: string, meetingType: 'first-call'|'partner-meeting'|'follow-up'|'due-diligence', companyMetrics: Record<string, unknown>, previousInteractions?: string }. Execute: use `generateStructuredReliable` to produce { talkingPoints: string[], anticipatedQuestions: Array<{ question: string, suggestedAnswer: string }>, metricsToHighlight: Array<{ metric: string, value: string, narrative: string }>, closingAsk: string, redFlags: string[] }. Return the result.

Import `tool` from 'ai', `z` from 'zod', `generateStructuredReliable` from '@/lib/ai/fred-client'.

**lib/agents/fundraising/agent.ts:**
Export `async function runFundraisingAgent(task: AgentTask): Promise<AgentResult>`:
- Import `runAgent` from '../base-agent', `fundraisingTools` from './tools', `FUNDRAISING_SYSTEM_PROMPT` from './prompts'
- Call `runAgent({ agentType: 'fundraising', systemPrompt: FUNDRAISING_SYSTEM_PROMPT, tools: fundraisingTools, maxSteps: 8 }, task)`
