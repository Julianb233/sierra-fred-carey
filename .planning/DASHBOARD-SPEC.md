# Sahara Dashboard Structure -- App & Website

## OVERVIEW

This document outlines the structural design for the Sahara dashboard across both web and mobile app environments. The dashboard is designed to reinforce decision clarity, execution focus, and funding readiness without overwhelming founders with noise.

The guiding principle:
**The dashboard must answer one question at all times -- "What should I work on right now?"**
