## Phase 1: Logged-OUT Tests

### Stream C -- Demo Pages

| Test | URL | Result | Details |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| C1 | /demo/boardy | PASS | Shows "Boardy Integration" demo with investor matching stats (47 matched, 12 intros, etc.). No login redirect. URL stayed on /demo/boardy. |
| C2 | /demo/virtual-team | PASS | Shows "Your AI Co-Founders Work While You Sleep" with Virtual Team Agents content. No login redirect. URL stayed on /demo/virtual-team. |
| C3 | /demo/investor-lens | PASS | Shows "Know If You're Ready to Raise" with Investor Readiness Score content. No regression. URL stayed on /demo/investor-lens. |

### Stream D -- Duplicate Logo

| Test | URL | Result | Details |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| D1 | /login | PASS | Only ONE Sahara logo visible in top-left nav bar. No duplicate. |
| D2 | /login | PASS | Nav links ("Pricing", "Features", "See It in Action", "About") all visible and not covered by a second logo. |
| D3 | /login | PASS | Screenshot captured as evidence. Clean login page with single logo, nav links, and auth form. |

## Phase 2: Logged-IN Tests (ALL SKIPPED)

No login credentials were available to the automated tester. All dashboard routes correctly show the login form when accessed without authentication (auth guard working properly).

### Stream A -- Dashboard Routing (SKIPPED)

| Test | URL | Result | Details |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| A1 | /dashboard/communities | SKIPPED | Redirected to login form (no auth). Cannot verify if it shows Communities vs Settings when logged in. |
| A2 | /dashboard/documents | SKIPPED | Redirected to login form (no auth). Cannot verify if it shows Documents vs Settings when logged in. |
| A3 | /dashboard/coaching | SKIPPED | Redirected to login form (no auth). Cannot verify if it shows Coaching vs Settings when logged in. |

### Stream B -- Loading Spinners (SKIPPED)

| Test | URL | Result | Details |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| B1 | /dashboard | SKIPPED | Requires auth to test spinner behavior. |
| B2 | /dashboard/strategy | SKIPPED | Requires auth to test spinner behavior. |
| B3 | /documents | SKIPPED | Requires auth to test spinner behavior. |
| B4 | /check-ins | SKIPPED | Requires auth to test spinner behavior. |

### Stream E -- Error States (SKIPPED)

| Test | URL | Result | Details |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| E1 | /dashboard/next-steps | SKIPPED | Requires auth to verify no "Failed to fetch" error. |
| E2 | /dashboard/settings | SKIPPED | Requires auth to verify notification section. |

## Observations

1. **Auth guard works correctly** -- All /dashboard/* routes render the login form for unauthenticated users. The URL stays on the requested path (no redirect to /login), but the page content shows the login form.
2. **Demo pages are fully accessible** -- All three demo pages (/demo/boardy, /demo/virtual-team, /demo/investor-lens) render their full content without requiring authentication. Stream C fix is confirmed working.
3. **Login page is clean** -- Single logo, all nav links visible, no visual issues. Stream D fix is confirmed working.
4. **To complete Phase 2**, test credentials would need to be provided to the automated tester, or manual testing should be performed for Streams A, B, and E.
