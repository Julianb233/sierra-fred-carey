### AI-878: FRED Chat Latency Investigation & 7 Fixes

Source files:
- `.planning/FRED-CHAT-LATENCY-REPORT.md`
- `.planning/FIXES-SUMMARY.md`

9 root causes identified, 7 fixes applied across 7 commits.
Before: 1.8s–8.1s worst case. After: 0.3s–5.4s worst case.

Key fixes:
- Added `export const maxDuration = 60` (critical — prevented Vercel timeouts)
- Disabled AI scoring by default (-800ms–2s per decision_request)
- Made `storeEpisode` fire-and-forget (-50–200ms)
- Parallelized IRS loading into Promise.all (-50–200ms)
- Cached gate redirect count from persistedModeResult (-30–100ms)
- Added LIMIT 100 to getAllUserFacts (prevents unbounded growth)
- Merged conversation state reads in context-builder (-30–100ms)

### AI-879: FRED Token Streaming

Source file: `.planning/STREAMING-IMPL.md`

End-to-end token streaming via SSE `token` events. `tokenChannel` threaded from route → service → machine → decide actor → `generateWithLLM` → `streamGenerate`.

Time to first visible character: 800ms–2s → ~100ms. 7–20x perceived latency improvement.

Files changed: `lib/fred/types.ts`, `lib/fred/machine.ts`, `lib/fred/actors/decide.ts`, `lib/fred/service.ts`, `app/api/fred/chat/route.ts`, `lib/hooks/use-fred-chat.ts`, `components/chat/chat-message.tsx`

### AI-880: Live Test Results

Source file: `.planning/LIVE-TEST-REPORT.md`

Live test on joinsahara.com using Stagehand browser automation.

Results:
- Greeting: <500ms first token, <1s total — PASS
- Question: ~1–2s first token, 3–4s total — PASS
- Decision request: ~0.5–0.8s first token, 5–6s total — PASS (streaming confirmed word-by-word)
- DB logging: conversation_state active, episodic memory active for Pro+ users

5 minor issues found (1 medium, 4 low) — documented in the issue.

## Gaps Remaining
