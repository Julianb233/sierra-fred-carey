## Memory

### Key Decisions (v2.0)
- PWA-first mobile strategy (not native app)
- Admin-only training docs section
- CSV upload for partner investor lists
- In-app message hub for Inbox Agent (not email integration)
- All three wellbeing modes (burnout detection + check-in + mindset coaching)
- Both intake approaches (questionnaire + auto-enrichment from conversations)
- Red flags: both inline chat warnings AND dashboard widget
- Everything in parallel (production, PWA, features, Fred voice simultaneously)

### Critical Gaps Found (v2.0 audit)
- Fred voice: only 3/21 AI interaction points use actual FRED_CAREY_SYSTEM_PROMPT
- Missing features: 8 promised features with no/partial implementation
- Production: no root middleware.ts, no robots.txt, no sitemap
- PWA: no install prompt, no offline page
- Mobile: pricing table breaks on 375px
- Data: inconsistent stats across pages (30+/40+/50+ years, $50M/$100M)
