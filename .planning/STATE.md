# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-11)

**Core value:** Founders can make better decisions faster using FRED's structured cognitive frameworks.
**Current focus:** v4.0 FRED Mentor Experience

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (run /gsd:create-roadmap)
Plan: --
Status: Milestone initialized, defining roadmap
Last activity: 2026-02-11 -- Milestone v4.0 started

Progress: [..............................] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

v4.0 milestone decisions:

- FRED is a mentor, not an agent — language and framing reflects coaching identity
- Reality Lens is a mandatory gate before tactical advice — Feasibility, Economics, Demand, Distribution, Timing
- Decision sequencing enforced — no downstream work (decks, patents, hiring, fundraising) until upstream truth established
- System prompt rebuilt from Fred Cary's master GPT instructions
- Onboarding → FRED seamless handoff — no repetition
- Gentle redirect when founders drift — acknowledge, then steer back
- Diagnostic mode switching is silent — frameworks introduced by context, not user choice
- Pitch Deck Review gated — 11-dimension scorecard only after upstream validation
- Every substantive response ends with Next 3 Actions

### Blockers/Concerns

- Sentry DSN needed (NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN, SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN)
- Twilio credentials needed (TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID)
- LiveKit credentials needed (LIVEKIT_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_API_SECRET, LIVEKIT_URL)
- Slack webhook URL needed (SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL)
- Resend API key needed (RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM_EMAIL)
- PostHog key needed (NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY)
- VAPID keys needed (NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY, VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, VAPID_SUBJECT)
